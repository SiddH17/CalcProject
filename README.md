# CalcProject
Everything related to the calculator project

Good day, everyone! This is our very own ML based scientific calculator, which will rely on text as well as image processing to find for the given word problems present within our dataset using Convolutional Neural Networking(CNN), Recurrent Neural Networking(RNN) and other similar Deep Learning based concepts.


Download/clone the master branch on your personal device using any one of the following steps:
	I. Clone the branch (Select 'Code<>' green button, copy the link and execute it on terminal/command prompt as 'git clone branch-clone-link')
	II. Create a pull request (Click on pull request -> new pull request)
	III. Download the ZIP file of the entire branch (available below the git cloning link)
	

REFER TO THE BELOW URL FOR INSTALLING AND RUNNING THE PROJECT ON DJANGO:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/djnago-installation-and-setup/

NOTE:

1. In case of setup, no need to execute the 'startproject' command as the project (The zip file you downloaded in this case) is already present. Instead, just simply navigate to the project folder using the 'cd' command. For example, if you have saved the cloned/downloaded repository in the folder 'Calculator', simply execute the command 'cd Calculator' and execute the rest of the commands that follow.

2. If after running the 'runserver' command the terminal command line throws errors such as missing libraries or components, fear not: simply press CTRL+C to abort the execution of the 'runserver' command and type in 'pip install missing-library-name' and download the misssing library. Keep doing this as long as you keep getting the missing library error until your server is up and running.
